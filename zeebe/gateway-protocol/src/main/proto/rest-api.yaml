            Otherwise, the variables are propagated to upper scopes and set at the outermost one.

            Letâ€™s consider the following example:

            There are two scopes '1' and '2'.
            Scope '1' is the parent scope of '2'. The effective variables of the scopes are:
            1 => { "foo" : 2 }
            2 => { "bar" : 1 }

            An update request with elementInstanceKey as '2', variables { "foo" : 5 }, and local set
            to true leaves scope '1' unchanged and adjusts scope '2' to { "bar" : 1, "foo" 5 }.

            By default, with local set to false, scope '1' will be { "foo": 5 }
            and scope '2' will be { "bar" : 1 }.
